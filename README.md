#MAP OF AZERBAIJAN

<p>This map was created using data from <a href="http://diva-gis.org/gData">diva</a>. Diva provided with the .shp file that is included under the rawData folder. That .shp file was opened and converted to geoJSON using <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">QGIS</a>. In order to export the map right click on the layer on the left and Save as geoJSON. In this example the geoJSON file of Azerbaijan is already under the data folder. </p>
<p>The rest of the d3.js code is under the index.html file</p>

##Enjoy!
